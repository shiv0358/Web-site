            <h2 class="section-title">New Technologies in Farming</h2>
            <p>Here are some revolutionary technologies transforming agriculture today:</p>

            <div class="technology-list">
                <h3>1. Precision Agriculture</h3>
                <p>Advanced technologies like IoT sensors, GPS, and drones enable farmers to optimize crop yields and manage resources efficiently by monitoring and analyzing real-time data.</p>

                <h3>2. Vertical Farming</h3>
                <p>Vertical farming allows crops to be grown in stacked layers, often indoors, using less space and water while reducing the carbon footprint of transportation and storage.</p>

                <h3>3. Drones and UAVs</h3>
                <p>Drones provide farmers with aerial views of their crops, helping to monitor plant health, assess irrigation needs, and apply pesticides more efficiently.</p>
